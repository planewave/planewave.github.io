## Real and complex signals

When doing the spectrum analysis, the signal is usually real-valued.
However, when studying the baseband signal in wireless communications, the data is complex-valued.
There is a significant difference in the processing of real and complex-valued signals for spectrum analysis.

You may notice the `periodogram` function in Matlab has an argument 'freqrange' that can be 'onesided', 'twosided', or 'centered'.
Similarly in matplotlib, the function `pyplot.specgram` has an argument 'sides' can be 'onesided' or 'twosided'.

This is because, for real signals, the DFT results are mirrored (conjugated to be specific) at fs/2.
In practice, only the spectrum from frequency 0 to fs/2 is shown.
Note that, to make sure the energy of the displayed half spectrum is the same as the whole spectrum, the value of the half spectrum is doubled, except the DC.

As for complex-valued signals, the DFT results are useful from 0 to fs.
The only thing we need to be cautious of is the frequency that is conventionally displayed from -fs/2 to fs/2.
So when using `periodogram` in Matlab, it is recommended to set 'centered' instead of leaving default or 'twosided'(0 to fs).
Whereas matplotlib can take care of it by default.

For example, if an SDR has a sampling rate of 56 MHz, the effective signal bandwidth is 56 MHz, not 28 MHz.
Isn't it breaking the Nyquist sampling theorem?
If you take a look at a diagram of an SDR, you can find the incoming signal is separated into two channels and they are multiplied by a pair of orthogonal carriers, then, sampled by two ADCs to generate the IQ signal.
We can not strictly consider each signal from one channel contributes half of the spectrum, so it is not violating the sampling theorem.
