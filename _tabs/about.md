Actively seeking jobs in Canada and the USA.

My name is Xiao Liu. I am a wireless system researcher with 6 years of industry experience and a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering. Possesses extensive expertise in PHY/MAC layer of wireless systems, specializing in non-cooperative RF signals. Proficient in developing high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms for wireless receivers. Skilled in creating Software-Defined Radio (SDR) tools for comprehensive RF signal handling. Hands-on experience with RF lab instruments and Python script development for automated system testing and diagnostics.


My skills are as follows:

- **Wireless Communication Systems**: Specialized in the PHY/MAC layer of LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa and proprietary protocols.
- **Wireless DSP Algorithms**: Developed battle-tested algorithms for non-cooperative RF signal detection, synchronization, equalization, demodulation and RF impairment mitigation.
- **SDR Tools**: Created comprehensive and user-friendly SDR tools for radio signal transmission, reception, measurement, and visualization.
- **RF Testing**: Created verification plans, test procedures and automated test scripts. Experienced with lab instruments. 
- **Programming & Tools**: Advanced MATLAB and Python. Proficient in Linux and Git version control.

In this blog, I want to share my technical notes and thoughts with the world. It would be my pleasure if it could help someone in this field.

Thank you.

Xiao Liu Ph.D.
