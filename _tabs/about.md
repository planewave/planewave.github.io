My name is Xiao Liu. I am a DSP Engineer, Wireless Researcher, Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. Currently, I am living in Vancouver, Canada.

In this blog, I want to share my technical notes and thoughts with the world. It would be my pleasure if it could help someone in this field. 

Open to remote jobs!
