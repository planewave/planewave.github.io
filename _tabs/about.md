My name is Xiao Liu. I am Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, a DSP engineer, wireless researcher.
Currently, I am living and working in Vancouver, Canada.

I am a professional in digital signal processing, with working experience of the physical layer of various wireless communication protocols and software-defined radio (SDR).
I wrote efficient, maintainable, and deliverable software that can transmit, detect and visualize signals.
I am also interested in machine learning / deep learning and audio signal processing.

In this blog, I want to share my technical notes and thoughts with the world. It would be my pleasure if it could help someone in this field.

Thank you.

Xiao Liu Ph.D.
