As a father of two, who is living in one of the most expensive cities in the world, life is full of challenges.
In most cases, after decomposition, they always go down to two reasons: the lack of money and/or time.
It's a simple truth, but I realized it very late.
Just like many years ago when I first start writing DSP code, all I cared about was the correctness.
The code has no readability, no struture, no efficiency.
